# Enhanced Ticket Privacy and Watcher System

## Overview
We have significantly enhanced the Coffee Cup Travel Plaza ticket system with comprehensive privacy controls and watcher management capabilities. This addresses the requirement for private tickets and interested party notifications.

## üîí Privacy System Features

### Privacy Levels
1. **Public** - Visible to all users with site access (default)
2. **Site Only** - Visible only to users assigned to the specific site
3. **Private** - Visible only to:
   - Ticket creator
   - Assigned user
   - Site contacts
   - Active watchers

### Privacy Enforcement
- Privacy checking function: `app.fn_CanUserViewTicket(@ticket_id, @user_id)`
- All ticket queries filter based on user permissions
- Privacy level can be changed via API: `PATCH /api/tickets/:id/privacy`
- UI shows privacy indicators with icons:
  - üëÅÔ∏è Public (green)
  - üë• Site Only (blue) 
  - üîí Private (red)

### Watcher Types
1. **Interested** - Basic notification recipient
2. **Collaborator** - Active participant in ticket resolution
3. **Site Contact** - Primary site representative
4. **Assignee Backup** - Secondary assignee for coverage

### Watcher Management
